# NBA-Hackathon-2018

In Fall 2018, a team consisting of myself and 3 other Carnegie Mellon Students competed at the NBA Hackathon in Secaucus, New Jersey. Our project consisted of two components; a business project (completed prior to the Hackathon) and a sprint project (completed the day of the Hackathon). 

Our business project examined the value of each NBA team in their city and market. From this data we determined expansion of the NBA and restructuring of the playoffs would help increase the leagues revenue and profitability. To this end, we proposed 4 new cities for expansion, along with a new playoff format similar to that of the NFL/MLB.

Our sprint project aimed to use Reddit/ESPN data to track mentions of players and determine player popularity at a given moment. Using this data we could derive a metric that determined how positively/negatively an entity is being perceived. From this metric we built a dashboard that showcased current trends and possible upsets. The dashboard provided users with information to assist with real-time betting, helping drive consumer engagement for the NBA. 

The attached presentations provide more detail about our projects!
